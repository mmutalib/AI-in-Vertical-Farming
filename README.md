# Methodology

# Data Collection:

Four trays with different light conditions were set up in a controlled vertical farm environment.
Cameras captured real-time images of plant growth.
Environmental factors such as soil quality, moisture, humidity, nutrients, and gas exchange were recorded.

# Image Analysis:

PlantCV, an open-source image processing software, was used for plant phenotyping.
Images were analyzed to measure plant growth area and monitor development over time.

# Machine Learning Models:

Multiple Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were compared.
ANN models demonstrated superior performance in predicting plant growth.

# Statistical Analysis:

Correlations between light conditions and plant growth metrics were explored.
Comparative analysis across different trays identified the most effective light treatments.

# Key Findings
Light Wavelength Impact: Certain light wavelengths, particularly in the red and blue spectra, significantly enhanced plant growth.
Model Accuracy: The ANN model outperformed traditional ML models in predicting plant growth with minimal error.
Environmental Factors: Soil quality, moisture, and other environmental factors were critical in optimizing plant growth and were effectively incorporated into the predictive models.

# Implications
